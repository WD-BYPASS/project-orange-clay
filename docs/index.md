### **Crimes:** {#crimes:}

In 2023, four criminal indictments were filed against Donald Trump, then a former president of the United States. Two indictments are on state charges (one in New York and one in Georgia) and two indictments (as well as one superseding indictment) are on federal charges (one in Florida and one in the District of Columbia).

The District of Columbia trial was put on hold in February 2024 while waiting for the Supreme Court to determine whether Trump is immune from prosecution. The case was returned to the District Court on August 2 to conduct hearings consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling. The 6-week-long New York trial began on April 15, 2024 with Trump convicted in all 34 charges and sentencing scheduled for November 26. On June 5, 2024, the Georgia trial was paused while the Georgia Court of Appeals decided whether to disqualify Fani Willis. It disqualified Willis on December 19. The following month, Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Florida case, ruling Jack Smith's appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional. The Office of the Special Counsel appealed the dismissal to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals two days later. Eleventh Circuit sent notice, officially receiving the request and requested briefing schedule of late August. The Special Counsel office has not requested an expedited briefing schedule.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him. Neither the indictments nor any resulting convictions would have disqualified his 2024 presidential candidacy. The Supreme Court separately addressed Trump's eligibility to be on the ballot and reversed all disqualifications by individual states. On July 1, 2024, the Court ruled 6–3, that Trump had immunity for acts he committed as president that were considered official acts, while also ruling that he did not have immunity for unofficial acts. On November 6, Trump won the 2024 election and as president-elect; after inauguration, Justice Department policy would preclude his prosecution and Trump has previously stated he will fire Smith; Smith resigned before Trump's inauguration.
